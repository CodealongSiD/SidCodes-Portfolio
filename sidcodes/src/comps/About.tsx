          Hey! I’m Siddharth a Fullstack Engineer from Bangalore, working mostly with the MERN stack. I love building smooth and easy-to-use interfaces, while also writing clean and efficient backend code. My background is in Computer Science (B.E.), and I’m really into understanding what makes great user experiences and creating APIs that just work.

          When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing football or gaming — two of my favorite ways to chill and recharge. If you want to say hi or chat about tech (or games!), check out the contact info below.
